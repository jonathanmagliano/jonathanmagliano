## Hello, World! I'm Jonathan.

Who's Jonathan?
Carioca, Rio de Janeiro, Football, Beach, you know? Oh, also... :books: I'm padawan in Python, R, JavaScript and Java.
I started on computers around 2003-2004 at a lan house. I was in that range between 7 and 8 years old.
ðŸ¤”ðŸ”­ I'm very curious. I really like the idea of being in a constant process of evolution personal and professional.

The values of entrepreneurial, proactive and uncomfortable by state of stagnation are notorious personal characteristics. Self-taught, resilient and determined.
